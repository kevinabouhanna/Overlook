# Spam Protection for Netlify Forms

This document outlines the spam protection measures implemented for the Overlook website's contact form.

## Implemented Protection Measures

### 1. Honeypot Field

A honeypot field is a hidden form field that is invisible to human users but visible to bots. When a bot fills out this field, the submission is automatically rejected.

Implementation:
- Added `data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` to the form
- Created a hidden input field named "bot-field"
- Applied multiple CSS hiding techniques to ensure it's invisible to humans:
  - `className="hidden"`
  - `style={{ display: 'none', visibility: 'hidden', position: 'absolute', left: '-9999px' }}`
  - `tabIndex="-1"` to prevent keyboard navigation to the field

### 2. reCAPTCHA Integration

Added Google reCAPTCHA v2 to the form to verify that the user is human.

Implementation:
- Added `data-netlify-recaptcha="true"` to the form
- Added a div with `data-netlify-recaptcha="true"` where the CAPTCHA should appear
- Netlify automatically handles the reCAPTCHA integration

### 3. Server-side Spam Filtering

Netlify automatically uses Akismet for spam filtering. Additionally, we've implemented a custom serverless function for additional filtering.

Implementation:
- Created `netlify/functions/form-handler.js` with additional spam checks:
  - Checks for suspicious email domains
  - Checks for suspicious content patterns
  - Validates message length
  - Performs additional honeypot validation

### 4. Security Headers

Added security headers in `netlify.toml` to help prevent various attacks:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Helps prevent XSS attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Restricts which resources can be loaded

## Handling Spam Submissions

If you continue to receive spam despite these measures:

1. Log into your Netlify dashboard
2. Go to Forms > Your Form > Spam
3. Review spam submissions and mark legitimate submissions as "Not Spam" if needed
4. Consider adding more patterns to the serverless function's spam detection

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. Upgrade to reCAPTCHA v3 for a more seamless user experience
2. Implement rate limiting for form submissions
3. Add IP-based blocking for persistent spammers
4. Integrate with additional third-party spam detection services
